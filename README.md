# MRI Swarm üß†

MRI Swarm is a powerful collaborative AI system designed for comprehensive MRI scan analysis. It leverages a swarm of specialized AI agents, each focusing on different aspects of MRI interpretation, to provide detailed and accurate analysis of medical imaging data.

## üåü Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Six specialized agents working together to analyze MRI scans
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: From anatomical structure to clinical correlation
- **Quality Control**: Built-in quality assessment and artifact detection
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates detailed summaries with potential diagnoses
- **Flexible Input**: Supports single or multiple MRI image analysis

## üîß Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from mri_swarm import mri_swarm

# Analyze a single MRI scan
result = mri_swarm(
    task="Analyze this brain MRI for signs of multiple sclerosis",
    img="path/to/brain_mri.jpg"
)
print(result)

# Analyze multiple MRI scans
results = mri_swarm(
    task="Compare these brain MRIs for progression of tumor",
    imgs=["scan1.jpg", "scan2.jpg"]
)
print(results)
```

## ü§ñ Agent Architecture

The system consists of six specialized agents and one summary agent:

1. **Anatomical Analysis Agent**
   - Anatomical structure identification
   - Brain region mapping and segmentation
   - Tissue type classification

2. **Pathology Detection Agent**
   - Tumor detection and classification
   - Lesion identification
   - Disease marker evaluation

3. **Sequence Analysis Agent**
   - T1/T2 weighted image interpretation
   - FLAIR sequence analysis
   - Diffusion-weighted imaging analysis

4. **Quantitative Analysis Agent**
   - Volumetric measurements
   - Signal intensity quantification
   - Statistical analysis

5. **Clinical Correlation Agent**
   - Symptom correlation
   - Treatment response assessment
   - Clinical outcome prediction

6. **Quality Control Agent**
   - Image quality assessment
   - Artifact detection
   - Protocol compliance verification

7. **Summary Agent**
   - Consolidates findings
   - Generates comprehensive reports
   - Provides diagnostic suggestions

## üìä How It Works

1. User submits an MRI analysis task with image(s)
2. The swarm initiates an interactive group chat
3. Specialized agents analyze different aspects of the scan
4. Agents collaborate and share insights
5. Summary agent consolidates findings
6. System returns comprehensive analysis report

## üéØ Use Cases

```python
# Case 1: Tumor Analysis
result = mri_swarm(
    task="Analyze this brain MRI for presence and characteristics of any tumors",
    img="tumor_case.jpg"
)

# Case 2: Multiple Sclerosis Assessment
result = mri_swarm(
    task="Evaluate these MRI sequences for MS lesions and disease progression",
    imgs=["ms_baseline.jpg", "ms_followup.jpg"]
)

# Case 3: Quality Assessment
result = mri_swarm(
    task="Assess the quality of this MRI scan and identify any artifacts",
    img="scan_quality_check.jpg"
)
```

## üìù Example Output

```python
{
    "findings": {
        "anatomical": "Normal brain structure with mild cortical atrophy",
        "pathological": "Multiple T2 hyperintense lesions in periventricular region",
        "sequence": "FLAIR sequence shows clear lesion definition",
        "quantitative": "Total lesion volume: 3.2cm¬≥",
        "clinical": "Findings consistent with relapsing-remitting MS",
        "quality": "Good image quality, no significant artifacts"
    },
    "diagnoses": [
        {
            "condition": "Multiple Sclerosis",
            "likelihood": "High",
            "evidence": "Multiple periventricular lesions, typical distribution"
        },
        {
            "condition": "Small Vessel Disease",
            "likelihood": "Low",
            "evidence": "Pattern and patient age not typical"
        }
    ],
    "recommendations": [
        "Follow-up scan in 6 months",
        "Consider contrast-enhanced study"
    ]
}
```
